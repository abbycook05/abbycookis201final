    Like a small boat<br>
    On the ocean<br>
    Sending big waves<br>
    Into motion <br>
    Like how a single word <br>
    Can make a heart open <br>
    I might only have one match <br>
    But I can make an explosion <br>
    And all those things I didn't say  <br>
    Wrecking balls inside my brain <br>
    I will scream them loud tonight <br>
    Can you hear my voice this time? <br>
    This is my fight song <br>
    Take back my life song <br>
    Prove I'm alright song <br>
    My power's turned on <br>
    Starting right now I'll be strong <br>
    I'll play my fight song <br>
    And I don't really care if nobody else believes <br>
    'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me <br>
    Losing friends and I'm chasing sleep <br>
    Everybody's worried about me <br>
    In too deep <br>
    Say I'm in too deep (in too deep)  <br>
    And it's been two years I miss my home  <br>
    But there's a fire burning in my bones  <br>
    Still believe <br>
    Yeah, I still believe <br>
    And all those things I didn't say <br>
    Wrecking balls inside my brain <br>
    I will scream them loud tonight <br>
    Can you hear my voice this time? <br>
    This is my fight song <br>
    Take back my life song <br>
    Prove I'm alright song <br>
    My power's turned on <br>
    Starting right now I'll be strong <br>
    I'll play my fight song <br>
    And I don't really care if nobody else believes <br>
    'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me <br>
    A lot of fight left in me <br>
    Like a small boat <br>
    On the ocean <br>
    Sending big waves <br>
    Into motion <br>
    Like how a single word <br>
    Can make a heart open <br>
    I might only have one match <br>
    But I can make an explosion <br>
    This is my fight song <br>
    Take back my life song <br>
    Prove I'm alright song <br>
    My power's turned on <br>
    Starting right now I'll be strong (I'll be strong) <br>
    I'll play my fight song <br>
    And I don't really care if nobody else believes <br>
    'Cause I've still got a lot of fight left in me <br>
    Know I've still got a lot of fight left in me <br>
